Rendering realistic looking grass in real-time is hard, especially on consumer graphics hardware because of its geometric complexity. The intent of this article and source provided is to introduce the concept of geometry instancing with Direct3D10 APIs to the reader and show how it can be used to implement a realistic looking grass on consumer graphics hardware.
